        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Chloe Walsh</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Juvenil</p>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</p>
        <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong><br>
          Tommens cheeky lad, Gerard Gibsie Gibson, is a comedian at heart, but underneath his happy-go-lucky-nature
          lurks a broken boy, tortured by the events of his past. Using humour to cope with his demons, Gibsie hides
          everything from the world.
          Only one person knows who he truly is on the inside. His friends little sister. His Claire-bear.
          Enveloped in sunshine, Claire Biggs has spent her whole life adoring the boy across the street. Her brothers
          friend. Seeing a side to Gerard that no one else sees, Claire is determined to tame her wild-at-heart
          childhood best friend.
          But when the unexpected occurs and lines are crossed, will Gibsie and Claires friendship survive? Will it
          blossom into something more, or will they lose themselves in the riptide?</p>

      <h4>Opinions</h4>
      <p><strong>Alicia:</strong> Honestly, it has been a very interesting book to read. Before I knew it, I was already
        at the end, and I highly recommend it if you’re looking for something with a mix of romance and drama. It really
        drew me in as a reader. ★★★★☆</p>

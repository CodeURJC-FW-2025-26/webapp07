# PARTICIPATION OF THE TEAM MEMBERS #

- Description of my tasks during the practice.
 During this project I have done the html of 5 of the books(book1.html, book2.html, book3.html, book4.html and book7.html) and half of one of them (book11.html), where I have maintained the header of the website with the option of adding a new book and the filter option. In addition to that, about the books, I have added the images of the book covers, aside from the name of the author, the genre of the book, the year in which the book was published, a brief synopsis and the overall rating of the reviews.Those reviews are showed just below all that it was mantioned before. In the opinions I have added the score that the user gave to the book next to their opinion. Last but not least, there is a footer where the user can go back to the main page of the book catalog, the button for adding a new opinion and the option of deleting the book or editing the book.

- Description of my tasks during the practice: 
My participation focused on the development and design of several important parts of the website. I worked on the visual aspect of the catalogue using **catalog-grid.css**, and on the creation of the main page **index.html**, ensuring that the design was clear and consistent with the rest of the project. I also developed **add-book.html** along with its style sheet **add-book.css**, taking care to ensure that the form for adding books was easy to understand and aesthetically pleasing. In addition, I contributed to **add-opinion.html**, allowing users to leave their opinions. During the whole project, I worked with my teammates to make sure the website looked good and adjusted properly to different devices and screen sizes.

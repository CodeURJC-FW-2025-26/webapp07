          When Noah fell in love with Nick, she knew their relationship would never be easy. They''re fire and
          electricity, and when they're together, every kind of sparks fly. After last summer, Noah thought their
          passion had grown stronger than their fear, but her life is about to turn upside-down again now that she''s
          starting university. Moving again while maintaining her relationship with Nick will be a difficult hurdle,
          with their age difference, campus life, dangerous parties, and inner demons stalking them both, reminding them
          of all they still don't know about each other.
          No matter how hard they try, there will always be wounds that won't close. Is Noah really prepared to overcome
          her fears and truly trust someone again? Will Nick be able to put his past behind him and keep his heart open?
          Or are they doomed only to burn each other's worlds down?</p>

      <p><strong>Alicia:</strong> Sinceramente, ha sido un libro muy interesante de leer. Sin darme cuenta ya iba por el
        final del libro y lo recomiendo mucho si buscas leer algo de romance mezclado con drama. Me ha enganchado como
        lectora. ★★★★☆</p>

        <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong><br>

          A love that couldn't be broken, except by the truth.<br>
          Lizzie Young has always felt she was too much everything. Diagnosed with bipolar disorder at a young age,
          she's never fit in with her family, her friends, her community. Lizzie wants to be accepted and understood,
          but with few people in her corner, she's carried her burdens and her trauma on her own.
          But when she meets a kind boy on the school bus, things start to look bright for the first time in her life .
          . .
          Hugh Biggs has an old soul and the wisdom of someone far beyond his years. A young man with a sharp mind and a
          firm code of ethics, he sees something in Lizzie Young that he can't resist. He wants to be her everything and
          shoulder her burden. And Lizzie wants that too.
          Lizzie and Hugh's bond seems unbreakable - their chemistry is electric, their love is potent, and their
          connection is soul deep - but even the truest love can be shaken by forces beyond control.</p>

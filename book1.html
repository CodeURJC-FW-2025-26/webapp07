            Johnny Kavanagh has everything going for him. On the rugby field, he’s a beast, even with the terrible injury he’s hiding. Everyone knows he’s destined to reach the top, but to get there, he can’t afford any distractions — not even the shy new girl at Tommen College.
            For Shannon Lynch, however, life has never been easy.
            Bullied and tormented, she arrives at Tommen College halfway through the school year in search of a fresh start. But when, on her very first day, she meets the famous Johnny Kavanagh, her plan to stay unnoticed is suddenly at risk.
            As they form a complicated friendship, forced to confront the undeniable chemistry between them, a dark secret threatens to destroy everything. But Johnny won’t give up on Shannon.</p>

            FALLING IN LOVE WAS EASY<br>
            WHAT COMES NEXT IS THE REAL CHALLENGE<br>
            After a devastating injury that has sent him to the sidelines, Johnny Kavanagh clings to his dreams as best he can. Lost, insecure, and in need of comfort, he decides to unravel the mysteries surrounding the blue-eyed girl he can’t stop thinking about for even a minute.
            Keeping a secret has never been a problem for Shannon Lynch. She knows all too well that demons and villains lurk not only in stories, but also in the real world. Traumatized after returning from Dublin and desperate to protect her younger brothers, Shannon ends up playing the same old charade while her future crumbles before her eyes. The only way to protect herself is to build a wall around her.
            Only one boy will be able to climb that wall — the same one who has stolen her heart. However, secrets are about to come to light that will change their lives forever. <br>
            Will the love between Johnny and Shannon survive it all?</p>
